    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
      My educational journey began at Mount Carmel School in Dwarka, New Delhi,
      where I completed my schooling up to the 10th grade. Later, I enrolled at
      New Sainik Public School in Najafgarh, New Delhi where I completed my +2.
      Pursuing my passion for technology, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in
      Computer Science from Amity University in Noida. I am a proud graduate of
      the 2022 batch.I am presently employed as a Software Engineer Trainee at
      Cognizant. Within Cognizant, I am a part of the Production Support Team,
      specifically assigned to the Xactpay application, which serves our
      esteemed client, Hartford. My primary responsibility involves diligently
      addressing and resolving incidents reported via the MTE application. To
      effectively resolve these incidents, I rely on my proficiency in Oracle
      database management and Java programming. This entails thorough
      investigation of our database and log files to identify the root cause of
      issues and determine appropriate solutions.
